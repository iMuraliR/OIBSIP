    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Murali R, an enthusiastic recent graduate excited to embark on a journey in the world of Software Development. With a solid foundation in Bachelors degree in Technology in EEE and course on Java and Web developement, I'm ready to contribute my passion and drive to create meaningful impact.

      During my academic journey, I developed a strong grasp of Java, HTML, and CSS, which I'm eager to apply in real-world scenarios. What excites me most is the opportunity to learn and grow while solving challenges.
      
      I believe in the power of collaboration and adaptability. I'm excited to work alongside experienced professionals, absorbing knowledge and refining my skills along the way. My dedication to innovation and attention to detail make me a strong contender for projects.
      
      Away from the desk, I'm an avid problems solving, which not only fuels my creativity but also teaches me important lessons about perseverance and stepping outside of my comfort zone.
      
      I'm eager to connect with like-minded individuals, learn from mentors, and contribute to projects that align with my passion for Software Development. Let's connect and explore the possibilities together!

      <h3>Multipurpose Solar Powered Agribot-Using Embedded C</h3>
      <p>In this project, A robot is proposed to perform specific agricultural activities plowing, seed sowing, weeding, and soil moisture monitoring.  Mostly used If and switch case condition in this program.The biggest problems faced by farmers,
        especially in rural areas, are low productivity rates and less
        exposure to appropriate technologies in the agriculture sector.
        Hence, additional support is required to carry out certain
        tasks on agricultural land. There are many modern methods
        and machines available in the market, but all farmers cannot
        afford to buy them. In this paper, a multi-purpose solarpowered Agribot for supporting agriculture purposes has been
        designed. This robot has four modes of operation: 1. Ploughing
        2. Seed sowing 3. Soil moisture monitoring 4. Weed removal.
        The robot is instructed to carry out these processes with
        details about the total land surface dimensions as well as the
        distance between plants. The variables are sent as SMS by the
        user to the GSM Module. A PIC Microcontroller receives the
        information. For the ploughing operation, the rotating blade
        and Plough will be activated. During the seed sowing mode,
        the robot starts to drop the seed by first loosening the soil and
        then covering the seed and then followed by dropping the
        seeds and covering the seed with loosened soil. Solar Panel has
        been provided to recharge these batteries. During the Weedremoving mode, a spinning blade removes the unwanted
        plants in between the sown seeds. During the soil moisture
        monitoring mode, sensors determine the exact moisture
        content of the land. Accordingly, it will switch the ON the
        water pump kept in the agriculture field. This highly costeffective robot can be shared by a large group of farmers</p>
